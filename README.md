# Exercise 
* In this exercise we have learnt how to use output (return) of a function inside another function (multiply by 10)
* But we had to use two buttons. First button finds sum of numbers between start-end.
* The second button gets this first function as parameter and return new results multiplying by 10

# Homework 
here we have to find a way to show (calculate or use both function by using one method or button or anything)
It means we will not use 2 seperate buttons nor calculation.
